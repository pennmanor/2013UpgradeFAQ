\section{Professional Development Questions\color{red}\hrulefill\color{black}}
\textbf{What professional development will be provided?}\\
The District Technology Team will offer short introductions to your device when you pick it up over the summer.

Professional development for the elementary level will begin at the Summer In-Service days and continue throughout the school year.

Professional development schedules for Manor Middle will be announced.

\textbf{What can I do to prepare for the new computers?}\\
The majority of the file conversion and preparation will be completed by Technology Support Staff at or shortly following the In-Service days.

Cease using iWork applications (Pages, Keynote, Numbers) and instead begin the transition to portable formats such as Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, or Google Docs.

\textbf{Why is iWork no longer available?}\\
Within the past upgrade cycle, iWork (Pages, Keynote, Numbers) is no longer offered at 'Educational Pricing' by Apple, Inc.
In order to install iWork on district MacBooks, individual licenses must be purchased, at a considerable cost.


Further, Microsoft Office and Google Drive allows creation of documents that will work on all devices; Mac, PC, and Linux.
This interoperability is a key factor in the Student 1-to-1 Program.

\section{Common Computer Upgrade Questions\color{red}\hrulefill\color{black}}
\textbf{Can I transfer my personal music from the old Mac to my new device?}\\
No. Personal music and photos will not be transferred to the new devices. Staff should back up their personal files on to their own external drives.

\textbf{Can I keep my old Mac?}\\
All staff have the option to keep their current MacBook devices until December 2014. The District Technology Team will offer assistance in file conversion and backups. \emph{However, absolutely no repairs or updates will be offered for these devices}.

Staff are encouraged to return their old devices as soon as they are comfortable so that they may be used to repair and replace the student cart devices.

\section{Common Windows Questions\color{red}\hrulefill\color{black}}
\textbf{What version of Windows do I have?}\\
The Windows PC laptops are loaded with Windows 8.1 Professional.

\textbf{How do I update software?}\\
All software will be updated automatically, and installed upon Shutdown. \emph{As such, it is very important to shut your computer down at the end of each day.}

If you do not shut down each day, the number of queued updates will accumulate and will exponentially increase the amount of time taken to boot up.

\textbf{Are students permitted to use my Android Tablet?}\\
Students are permitted to use staff tablets, strictly under supervision of the staff member. Please be aware that the students may access, edit, or delete any applications and data on the tablet.

\textbf{iMovie $\to$ Windows Movie Maker}\\
Windows Movie Maker allows you to import clips and create movie projects with a visual editor similar to iMovie.

\textbf{GarageBand $\to$ Audacity}\\
